Pill reminder

A client has asked for an app where they can mark that the have taken a pill and the when it was taken.  They often forget if or when they take their pills due to the number they take and an app to track it would help them manage this more easily while also helping their health.

MVP

Pills should have a name, type and strength
The app should allow the user to create and edit pill type i.e painkillers, vitamins, etc
When you take a pill the Time should be recorded

Possible extension
